MKDoc::XML - MKDoc XML stuff
============================

MKDoc::XML is a suite of low level XML processing modules which comprises:

* An XML tokenizer
* An XML tree builder
* A configurable XML markup stripper
* A configurable XML markup tagger
* An XML entity encoder
* An XML entity decoder
* An HTML-Only entity decoder
* An XML Dumper / Undumper

Typically, in MKDoc the stripper is used to remove unwanted presentational
markup while the tagger adds structural markup such as <abbr> tag or automatically
hyperlinks expressions so that MKDoc users don't have to know about <a> tag syntax.
